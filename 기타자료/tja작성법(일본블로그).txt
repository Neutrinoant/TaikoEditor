TITLE:
Title of the song.

LEVEL:
level. Notation with 뫜. If natural number maybe there is no upper limit.

BPM :
Song of BPM . Decimal can be specified.

WAVE:
The wav file name to play. Even ogg .모

OFFSET:
The difference between the start position of the score and the time of playing the wav file. It is specified in seconds. 
If you specify minus, the song will start earlier than the start of the score.

BALLOON:
Strokes of Goki succession and potato strokes. Designate as many as the number of balloons, separated by (comma). 
Please do not include line breaks between numbers and numbers. 
In case of omitting, it is uniformly 5 strokes.

SONGVOL:
Volume of music data. Enter the percentage based on 100.

SEVOL:
The volume of the drum sound. Enter the percentage based on 100.

SCOREINIT:
You can specify the score when hitting a small note with good judgment when it is less than 10 combos. 
When the scoring system is stable, the scoring is entered after entering a comma like 550, 800.

SCOREDIFF:
10 Specify the score per hit to be added for each combo. 
If you enter the alphabet d at the end of the value, the addition of points per hit becomes only once when 200 combo is exceeded. 
If you enter SCOREINIT: 1000, SCOREDIFF: 1000 d, you will get a full course score (big notes will double the score). In addition, the go-go time will be treated as a 1.2-point score.

COURSE:
"Easy" "Normal" "Hard" "Oni" "Edit" Enter a value from 0 to 4. 
The first four correspond to 'simple', 'normal' 'difficult' 'toe', 
and how to increase the number of norm gauges changes (AC standard, but it may be different). 
When set to Edit, the score will conform to SCOREINIT and SCOREDIFF. Norma is the same as duck. 
In "Easy" "Normal", the display of the Norma Gauge collapses somewhat. 
When omitted, it is treated as "Oni". 
When "Tower" or 5 is inserted, hit notes are always displayed above donkeys and blindfolds. 
Norma gauges and scoring are treated the same as Edit.
STYLE:
Enter "Single" "Double" "Couple" or a number from 1 to 2. 
Single means playing alone, Double and Couple shows that it is a musical score for two players. There is no difference between Double and Couple. 
By inserting #START P1, # START P2 after Double (Couple) you can enter a different score on 1P side and 2P side. 
If you select a different course in 1P and 2P when selecting music notes, even if there is a music score for two players, a music score for single player flows.

GAME: Enter either "Taiko" or "Jube". If omitted, it will be treated as "Taiko".
모모모Type of music you enter. In "Jube" it will be autoplay only.

LIFE:
life. When this value is set, the performance will be forcibly interrupted when the life decreases to 0 each time it becomes impossible. Life will decrease continuously even if you give out impossible at short intervals. If you omit it or enter 0, it becomes normal gauge gauge.

DEMOSTART:
The playback start position of the demonstration played on the music selection screen. It is specified in seconds. 
If omitted, it will be played from the beginning of the music file.

SIDE:
"Normal" "Ex" "Both" or enter numbers 1 to 3. If omitted, it is "3". 
When "Normal" or "1" is entered, songs are displayed only when in table state on the song selection screen, and when 
"Ex" or "2" is entered, it is displayed only when it is in reverse side. 
You can switch between front and back states by inputting the left and right edges (D, K key) alternately ten times on the song selection screen. 
You can not specify more than one SIDE: in one music file.

SUBTITLE:
Subtitle of the song. On the result screen, it is displayed as a smaller size (0.8 times) under the title. 
"Title subtitle" is displayed in the order 
of titles being played, but if you enter "-" at the beginning of the subtitle, subtitle will not be displayed in the title of the song you are playing. 
You can also explicitly display subtitles by adding "++".

SCOREMODE:
Scoring method. Enter a number between 0 and 2. If omitted, 1. 
It will be in full mode from 0, in the order before AC14, newly allocated point. 
The section surrounded by # START and # END is taken as music score data. 
By specifying the course with COURSE: just before, you can describe the score of a different course in a single music file at once.

After specifying Double or Couple with STYLE:, you can enter # START P1 or # START P2 instead of # START to separately enter 1P side and 2P side music. 
Separate each bar with (comma). 
The number of characters per bar is the minimum unit of measure (4-minute unit for 4 characters, 16-minute unit for 16 characters). Also, since the maximum number of characters per bar is about a little 500, if you try to divide a note in extremely fine detail, an error will occur or it will kill it.

note
The correspondence between each character and a note is as follows.

0 = rest 
1 = Don 
2 = cutlet 
3 = Don (large) 
4 = cutlet (large) 
5 = barrage started 
6 = battered (large) starting 
7 = Geki barrage started 
9 = potato battered start 
8 = battered ends 
from repeated pressing the start I will make a series of hits between 8 and 8. It looks like "500008".

It is okay to spread the same numbers like "555558".

Not corresponded to notes such as bells and denden.

After / / (half-width slash two), it is treated as a comment and ignored. It might be used instead of memos. 
If you omit the end of Goki repeatedly, the next note that did not break the balloon will be forcibly disabled. 
If you insert "9" between the start and the end of a potato striking, that position becomes a border with 5000 points. 
If there are two or more 9s between "909900008", the last 9 positions are used. 
When not sandwiching 9 between "900000008", the position 0.6 times the length of the successive hit becomes the border.

If you hit repeated hits earlier than the border, you get 5000 points, after that 1000 points scores will be entered.

For example) 
"1111," four times at 4 minute intervals. 
For "10101212," the 모same is true for the case of "Don Dong Dokadoka" 
"1010 
1212," at 8 minute intervals .

order
Instructions begin with "#". Please be sure to fill in from the beginning of the line. 
Some instructions can also be reflected in the middle of a bar.

#BPMCHANGE ??
BPM was specified in ?? BPM to change. Decimals are also acceptable.

# GOGOSTART
Go-go started.

# GOGOEND
Go-go time end. Please be sure to end it when you start.

#MEASURE? /?
Change the time signature to the? /? Time signature. "4/4" with four quarter beat, "6/8" with eighth sixth beat. 
If omitted, it is 4/4.

# SCROLL ??
Doubles the scroll speed of music. The default is 1.00. 
The interval actually hit does not change, it changes only as it looks.

# DELAY ??
Delay the timing at which the following notes flow by? Seconds. Specifications finer than 0.001 seconds are ignored. Please use it when 
BPM does not change but slight deviation occurs due to the joint of songs.

#SECTION
Reset the number of consecutive hits and precision used to judge music branch. 
Please put it more than one measure before the branch point.

#BRANCHSTART ?, X, Y
Start the music branch. 
If you insert "r" in the?, You can branch (roll) by number of consecutive hits, branch (precision, perfect) with precision if you insert p, and branch with score (score). 
When the number of consecutive hits at the time of branch judgment is equal to or more than Y stroke or the precision is Y% or more, the program branches to the 
spiritual score when the number of consecutive strokes is X strokes or more or X% or more 
. If it is set so that X> Y, it will not branch to a professional spiritual score. 
Branch judgment is done one measure before this command (If you continue to hit from one bar before, it will count that successive hit).

#BRANCHEND
I will finish the music branch. From now on, a common score will flow through all branches. 
Can be omitted if branching is not required.

#N
After this, enter the ordinary notation from the score branch (Normal).

#E
After this you enter the score of the professional from the music branch (Expert).

#M
After this, enter the master's score from the music branch (Master). 
# N, # E, # M measures are aligned to the number of measures in the first music score. 
Minutes that are short of length are filled with blanks, but it will be strange if it is long, so it is safer to enter the number of measures aligned.

#LEVELHOLD
If this command reaches a certain measure, branching is not performed even if there is a music branch thereafter, and the current music notation is maintained.

# BMSCROLL
Please write before #START. 
In the presence of this command, the scrolling of the score is forced to be the same way as Taiko Taro (the value of #SCROLL is ignored). 
Also, at this point # of music scrolling stops where there is # DELAY.

#HBSCROLL
Please write before #START. 
If this instruction is present, it will forcefully scroll with BMSCROLL including # SCROLL effect.

#BARLINEOFF
Do not display barlines in measures following this command. 
It also applies to the yellow line when branching.

#BARLINEON
We will display barlines of measures following this command.
